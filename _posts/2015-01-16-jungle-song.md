## Jungle Song ðŸŽ¶ 

###### A song by Maddison & Mum

Chorus
Welcome to the jungle,
We've got fun and games.
Dinosaurs , kangaroos
And pterodactyls too!

And don't forget the King.


Verse One

If you come down to the jungle
The king will torture you.
He will stomp you, he will munch you
Until your dead right through


Chorus
Welcome to the jungle,
We've got fun and games.
Dinosaurs , kangaroos
And pterodactyls too!

And don't forget the King.

  
Verse Two

Chorus
Welcome to the jungle,
We've got fun and games.
Dinosaurs , kangaroos
And pterodactyls too!

And don't forget the King.
